Hello! Thanks for using my version of stepmania skin for osu!mania. :D

~~~ IMPORTANT NOTES ~~~
- SINCE I DO NOT OWN MOST THE SKIN ELEMENTS. I DON'T MIND SHARING TO ANYONE.
- I DID NOT CREATED THIS FOR BUSINESS. I JUST NEED SOME HELP FOR MY MAPS THO. XD
- IF YOU WANT TO MODIFY THIS SKIN, REMIND OF THE RISK THAT YOU'LL ABOUT TO TAKE WHEN YOU EDIT THIS BECAUSE SOME OF THE CONTENTS OF THE SKIN ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES. ESPECIALLY FILE NAMES, FOLDER NAMES, AND SKIN.INI MODIFICATIONS.
- PLEASE DON'T CLAIM THIS SKIN AS YOURS. I AM JUST CLAIMING OTHER STUFFS HERE CAUSE I DID THE HOMEWORK. LOL
- IF YOU WANT TO DONATE TO ME, I JUST WANT A OSU-SUPPORT TAG.
- MORE SKIN UPDATES TO COME FOR YOUR PLEASURE. :D
